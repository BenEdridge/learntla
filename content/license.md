Currently, this guide is still in rough draft form. While I wanted to make it accessible earlier than the final version, there's still a lot for me to add, edit, and improve. So for now, all rights reserved, etc. The tentative plan is to transition to Creative Commons once this is ready (estimated end of March 2017), but for now, there's still work to do.
