This guide is still under heavy revision: I put it up now because it might still be somewhat useful, and because I need to start gathering more feedback on what works and what doesn't. Here are some of the changes that need to be made:

* Consistency in the TLA+ snippets
* Better syntax highlighting
* General copyediting
* Better explanations of the examples
* More examples, period.

As always, if you have any questions, complaints, or comments, feel free to [send them my way](mailto:h@learntla.com).
